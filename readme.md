# Prerequisites

### You will need...

- **A vanilla copy of Rock Band 3** for PS3 or Xbox 360 that you can extract onto your PC
- For Console: A **modded/hacked PS3 or Xbox 360** and a way to transfer files to it, we reccomend using FTP
- For Emulator: A **mid-to-high-end PC** capable of running RPCS3 or Xenia

# Setup

*There are a couple different ways you can set up Rock Band 3 Deluxe, you can download a [Pre-Built Version](#pre-built-versions) or [set up the Repo](#repo-setup).*

***Pick which one is best for you.***

## Pre-Built Versions

There pre-compiled versions of Rock Band 3 Deluxe available in many flavors in the [Actions](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/actions) tab of this repo and in the [Nightly link](https://nightly.link/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/workflows/build/main). These are ready-to-install files for Rock Band 3 Deluxe for both platforms.

These are recommended if you have no way of setting up the repo (unspported platform, no administrator privelages, etc) or if you get stuck at any point.

### The different flavors are as follows:

* RB3DX-*platform*-Base - The default build of Rock Band 3 Deluxe
* RB3DX-*platform*-original-mids - Rock Band 3 Deluxe, but without any harmonies or chart updates
* RB3DX-*platform*-keys - A build of Rock Band 3 Deluxe with included additional keys upgrades from [rb3_plus](https://github.com/rjkiv/rb3_plus)
* RB3DX-PS3-stock-instrument-mapping - A build of Rock Band 3 Deluxe where Guitar Hero and Rock Revolution drum kits on PS3 are restored to their correct controller mapping. Only useful if you have either of these two instruments and are playing on PS3 hardware

If you're going to be installing a pre-built version, skip down to the [Install](#install) section. Any mention of `_build` is the contents of the zip file you downloaded from the Actions tab or Nightly link.

## Repo Setup
Setting up the Rock Band 3 Deluxe repo for the first time is meant to be as easy as possible.
As well, it is designed to allow you to automatically receive updates as the repo is updated.

Simply go to the [Releases](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/releases) of this repo and grab the `_init_repo` script for your platform. Currently there is a `.bat` file for Windows and a `.sh` file for linux, as well as a specific one for the Wii branch.

Included on the release are a couple dependencies, [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), and [Dot Net 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime). **These are both required in order to properly build Rock Band 3 Deluxe**.

In addition to this, you will also need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend version **3.9 or later**.

**Install all three of these with their default options.** If you're unable to, head back to [Pre-Built Versions](#pre-built-versions) and follow those instructions instaed.

Once they are all installed, in **an empty folder**, run `_init_repo.bat` if you're on Windows or `_init_repo.sh` if you're on Linux. This will pull the repo down for you and make sure you're completely up to date. This will take some time. If it opens and immediately closes, make sure you have [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed.

### **The folder should now look like this:**

![Repo Folder](dependencies/images/repofolder.png)

From then on, navigate to the `user_scripts` folder and simply run `build_ps3.py`, `build_xbox.py`, or `build_xenia.py` depending on your platform to stay updated and build Rock Band 3 Deluxe.

*If any of these open and immediately close, make sure you have all the required dependencies installed.*

After that, everything you need to run the mod (minus the vanilla game) will be in `\_build\xbox\gen\` or `\_build\ps3\USRDIR\gen\`.

# Install

*If you're jumping here from somewhere and you haven't read the above, make sure you follow [Setup](#setup) first.*

## Xenia Emulator

Xenia is the most convenient way for us to test our mods, and we recommend you do so if you ever decide to contribute to this project.

To install on Xenia, first extract your vanilla Rock Band 3 game disc and extract **ONLY** the *contents* of the `gen` folder in `\_build\xbox\gen\`.

Then, navigate to `user_scripts` and run `build_xenia.py` to automatically build and run Rock Band 3 Deluxe. If it opens and immediately closes, make sure you have [Dot Net 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) installed.

*If it opens to a black screen, that means you don't have your vanilla Rock Band 3 disc's `gen` folder extracted to `\_build\xbox\gen\`.*

**`\_build\xbox\gen\` should now look like this:**

![Xbox Repo](dependencies/images/xboxrepo.png)

*NOTE: If you experience bugs regarding textures or models, navigate to `_xenia`, open `xenia-canary.config.toml` in your text editor of choice, and change `gpu` from `vulkan` to `d3d12` and `d3d12_readback_resolve` from `false` to `true` (you may need to press `CTRL + F` to find these). This will fix all texture issues but will drasticly affect the framerate, you also may experience BSODs. If you don't want to deal with any of this, we recommend using [RPCS3](#rpcs3-emulator) instead.*

![D3D12](dependencies/images/d3d12.png)
![Readback Resolve](dependencies/images/readbackresolve.png)

## RPCS3 Emulator

To install on RPCS3, first extract your vanilla Rock Band 3 game disc and place it in the `games` folder in your RPCS3 directory. ***Do NOT touch this folder once it's installed, it is needed to run Rock Band 3 Deluxe as it installs as a PS3 update and must be installed in its own respective folder, shown below.***

Then, copy the contents of `\_build\ps3\` to `\dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\`.

*If the `BLUS30463` folder does not exist, create it.*

*If you are asked to overwrite any files, click `Yes`.*

**`\dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\` should now look like this:**

![RPCS3 Path](dependencies/images/rpcs3path.png)

To update Rock Band 3 Deluxe, repeat [the above steps](#rpcs3-emulator). You can click the `Watch` button (All Activity) to be notified about any updates that occur.

*NOTE: If you experience bugs regarding textures or models, right-click Rock Band 3 in your RPCS3 games list and create a custom configuration. Then, go to the `GPU` tab and enable `Write Color Buffers`. This will not affect the framerate nearly as much as it does on Xenia.*

![GPU Tab](dependencies/images/gputab.png)
![Write Color Buffers](dependencies/images/writecolorbuffers.png)

## PS3 Hardware

**NOTE: You WILL need a HACKED/MODDED (CFW or HFW/HEN) PS3 in order to play this mod on console. We hope this is clear.**

**NOTE: If you are using a Guitar Hero or Rock Revolution drum kit, navigate to `\_ark\config\`, delete `joypad.dta`, and rebuild Rock Band 3 Deluxe, or head back to [Pre-Built Versions](pre-built-versions) and download `RB3DX-PS3-stock-instrument-mapping`.**

***NOTE: Do NOT touch any of the contents of your vanilla game, Rock Band 3 Deluxe installs as a PS3 update and must be installed in its respective folder, shown below.***

To install on a real PS3, first you need to make sure you have Rock Band 3 version `1.05` installed on your system. You can check this by inserting your disc, pressing `Triangle`, and scrolling down to `Check for Update`. If it asks you to update, do so here.

Then, copy the contents of `\_build\ps3\` to `\dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\`.

*If the folder does not exist, that means you have not installed Rock Band 3 version `1.05`.*

*If you are asked to overwrite any files, click `Yes`.*

**`\dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\` should now look like this:**

![RPCS3 Path](dependencies/images/rpcs3path.png)

To update Rock Band 3 Deluxe, repeat [the above steps](#ps3-hardware). You can click the `Watch` button (All Activity) to be notified about any updates that occur.

## Xbox 360 Hardware

**NOTE: You WILL need a HACKED/MODDED (RGH or JTAG) Xbox 360 in order to play this mod on console. We hope this is clear**

On Xbox, copy the contents of `\_build\xbox\` to the location where your vanilla copy of Rock Band 3 is.

**Your `gen` folder should now look like this:**

![Xbox Repo](dependencies/images/xboxrepo.png)

If you're installing Rock Band 3 Deluxe for the first time, it is reccomended that you rename the vanilla `default.xex` to `default_vanilla.xex` for safety.

Make sure you clear your song cache, as well as your system cache.

To clear your song cache, navigate to `System Settings > Storage > Rock Band 3` and delete the song cache.

To clear your system cache, navigate to `System Settings > Storage` and press `Y` to clear the system cache.

Also, make sure to `disable` updates for Rock Band 3 in Aurora. Rock Band 3 Deluxe rolls `TU5` into its base installation.

If you are also running [RB3Enhanced](https://github.com/RBEnhanced/RB3Enhanced), grab the optional folders in `\_build\_optional-xbox-rb3e-rawfiles\` and place the `config` and `ui` folders next to the `gen` folder on your Xbox.

To update Rock Band 3 Deluxe, repeat [the above steps](#xbox-360-hardware). You can click the `Watch` button (All Activity) to be notified about any updates that occur.

# Optional Upgrades

*These are some optional, but very handy additions you can make to your Rock Band 3 Deluxe installation.*

## Songs

You can find song packs compatible with all Rock Band titles for both platforms on this [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-3lo2ASxM-3yVr_JH14F7-Lc1v2_FcS5Rv_yDCANEmk/edit#gid=0).

You can also use [Onyx Music Game Toolkit](https://github.com/mtolly/onyxite-customs) to generate your own custom song packs for Rock Band games. Converting custom songs from games like Clone Hero is incredibly easy.

## [rb3_plus](https://github.com/rjkiv/rb3_plus) Keys Upgrades

[rb3_plus](https://github.com/rjkiv/rb3_plus) features optional Keys and Pro Keys upgrades that you can install alongside Rock Band 3 Deluxe fairly easily. These upgrades include new audio files (.mogg's) for the upgraded songs. These take up additional file size and generally are a generation removed from the original audio mix with additional processing, but can be a great addition for any Keys or Pro Keys player.

You can download a build of Rock Band 3 Deluxe containing these upgrades from the [Actions](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/actions) tab of this repo and in the the [Nightly link](https://nightly.link/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/workflows/build/main).

## Installing Custom Textures

This repo also supports the import of custom highways and groove/spotlights via the use of a script.

Rock Band 3 Deluxe includes a variety of custom highways by default, available in the `RB3DX Settings` menu in-game, but you can also add your own with the following steps.

Simply drag in a .jpg/.png/.bmp into `\custom_textures\highways\`, then navigate back to `user_scripts` and run `process_textures_highway.py`.

Or, drag in a .jpg/.png/.bmp into `\custom_textures\spotlights`, then navigate back to `user_scripts` and run `process_textures_spotlight.py`.

This will size your images accordingly, including those with arbitrary resolutions, and convert them to the proper format for Rock Band 3 Deluxe to read. Spotlights will be set to 50% opacity.

**You will need to rebuild Rock Band 3 Deluxe in order for these to take effect.**
